### Who am I?

My name is Rodrigo Caraballo and I am a full-stack developer. I live in PaysandÃº, Uruguay and I am 24 years old. I am currently looking for my first job experience to expand my knowledge as a developer, belong to a group that supports continuous improvement, and collaborate with colleagues to achieve high-level objectives. My short-term goal is to find a job opportunity that allows me to grow and learn more skills.

#### Education

I am a student of the **Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology** at UTEC with one year completed. The program aims to train a person with technical skills in programming, infrastructure, testing, group administration, and business management related to IT. **UTEC Curriculum** ([https://utec.edu.uy/es/educacion/carrera/licenciatura-en-tecnologias-de-la-informacion/](https://utec.edu.uy/es/educacion/carrera/licenciatura-en-tecnologias-de-la-informacion/))

In addition, I participated in the intensive training provided by SofkaU, which aims to provide technical knowledge focused on a full-stack profile and validate essential skills necessary for teamwork and a good work environment. **Training League details** ([https://sofkau.com/training-leagues/](https://sofkau.com/training-leagues/))
